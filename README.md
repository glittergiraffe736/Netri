## Other Ideas for the Project
* Descriptions of each ethnicity including history, region, culture, etc.
* Podcast to go with the website with interviews of local restaurants/small businesses that are run by people of various ethnic groups
* Interview professors of history, anthropology, and those who study specific ethnic groups
* Playlists of music from that culture to go with each post 
* AI last name ethnicity search - gives you breakdowns of possible ethnic groups you may be a part of based on certain characteristics of your last name
* Have links for people to learn the language(s) of the culture - compile a list of them and just put links at the end (or a little box on the side that leads people to a resources page where there is a bunch of resources for users to learn more)
* Ask people to translate pages into their native languages to better expand our audience

## Plan

After we finish with South Asia, we will split up research on the ethnicities of the Middle East, SE Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia. Then we will do Africa and Austrailia and finish it up with the Americas and Europe.
