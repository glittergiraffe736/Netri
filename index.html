        <h1>Welcome to Nētri!</h1>
        <h2>What is Nētri?</h2>
        <p>Nētri is a website dedicated to spreading a collective understanding and respect of the many cultures and communities around the world. We are based in the state of Washington, so information of the diasporic communities and local cultures of our state are more readily available to us and therefore may have more detailed entries. If you would like to contribute to an article or podcast episode about your culture, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
        <h2>Why do we need Nētri?</h2>
        <p>In a world full of chaos, it's easy to hold misconceptions about different cultures. Our team noticed a rising sense of ignorance among the American population, with people believing things about others that simply weren't true. Nētri is our way of fighting these harmful stereotypes and encouraging people to appreciate the diversity of the cultures on Earth. After all, <i>ignorance is the selfish man's bliss.</i></p>
        <h2>So, what do you think?</h2>
        <p>Are you ready to jump in, stand up, and open your eyes to the whole, wide world?</p>
